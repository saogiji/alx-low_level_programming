# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
## Introduction
Bit manipulation is a project done for the ALX Software Engineering programe. 
It is aimed at understanding conversion between different number system such as binary,
decimal hexadecimal and different data types such as int, unsigned int, char etc.
The tasks for the project are writing a;
1. function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
2. function that prints the binary representation of a number
3. function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
4. function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
5. function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
6. function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
7. function that checks the endianness.
8. And finding the password to a progrram.
